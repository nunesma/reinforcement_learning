# Deep Q-Network (DQN)


This repository contains material related to Deep Q-Network (DQN). <br><br>


When there are billions of possible unique states and hundreds of available actions for each of them, the function Q(s, a) is represented by a matrix of values (Q-Learning algorithm). So, this table becomes too big, and tabular methods become impractical.  <br><br>

The Deep Q-Networks (DQN) algorithm was invented by Mnih et al. [1] to solve this. It combines the Q-Learning algorithm with deep neural networks (DNNs). DNNs are great non-linear function approximators. They are used to approximate the Q-function, replacing the need for a table to store the Q-values. <br><br>
